PICKING UP? Please READ:
INSTRUCTIONS FOR PICKUP
Here's how it works:
Order online by scrolling down the page or clicking the menus above. Once your order is submitted successfully you'll receive a confirmation email.
All further correspondence beyond the confirmation email will be via TEXT to the number you provide.
We will alert you by text when your order is ready at which time, please come to the pickup counter by the bar.  Be sure to provide your cell phone number not a land line or you won't receive the message!
In the meanwhile, please relax in your car, on one of our benches or enjoy the mountain views. If you are not here when you receive the message, give us a call or let the kiosk host know you have arrived. Be safe everyone.
**WE DON’T SERVE FOLKS WITH ALLERGIES**
- we only have one kitchen and literally 300 ingredients/spices. Our own adult daughter has a number of allergies and carries an epipen so we understand and will not take any chances with your health- please don't ask us to. You never know when an allergy will become life threatening rather than just a bother.
REMINDER:
This online ordering system inserts your order in our ticket system automatically with an ESTIMATED TIME. It’s not an exact time. This is not fast food and everything is made fresh, to-order.. please be patient.
Thank you.

We specialize in NY pizza- these include: traditional round thin-crust and Sicilian, which is a thick crust pan pizza. In addition, we have added Chicago's famous Tavern Style and Detroit's famous Red Top!  We make all of our own doughs and saucesdaily with days of proofing to bring out the incredible flavors of our proprietary flour. There is no such thing as "canned sauce" here. All recipes are Antonio's own and inspired by his mother and grandmother.
